This repository demonstrates a couple of uncommon errors in MATLAB that can be tricky to debug:

1. **Incorrect Array Indexing:**  MATLAB's 1-based indexing can lead to errors if you attempt to access elements outside the array's bounds.  The example shows how accessing `matrix(5)` in a 2x2 matrix will cause an error.

2. **Unexpected Input to Functions:**  Improper input type or dimensions to functions could lead to unexpected results or crashes. The code showcases a function `myFunction` that may not correctly handle various input types.

The `bugSolution.m` file provides corrected versions of the code, demonstrating good practices for handling potential errors.
